Data was processed using a combination of Jupyter Notebook python scrips and standard python scripts. 

### Step 1: Processing the log data into 8 separate linux command datasets
- - -
Run the `process_log` notebook in the `notebooks` folder. This should take a while. Adjust the number of CPUs used for processing depending on the system.

### Step 2: Pruning the data
- - -
Run each notebook in `notebooks` corresponding to the dataset to be pruned.
